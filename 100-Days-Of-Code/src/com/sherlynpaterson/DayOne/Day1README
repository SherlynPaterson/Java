100 days of Java day 1 August 5, 2021:

I've had interactions with Java over the years in a variety of different scenarios:
    - attempts to teach myself
    - trying my hand at a class in university which I dropped because I felt it was too easy and not
        in line with what I was learning on the linux side in my Information Systems curriculum.
        (That was bad judgement on my part and I should've stuck it out)
    - most recently attending a 14 week coding bootcamp from the end of Nov. 2020 - March 2021

While a lot of it has stuck, I realize I am a person who needs a lot of repetition and potentially a slower pace
    to make sure I completely grasp what I was learning and to build more confidence in myself.

This 100 days of coding is meant to go back to the basics, and move forward again, projects will include the
    simplest of things (I mean, who hasn't written a "Hello World" statement in their life if they've even
    tried one piece of code. I'll also slowly bring projects that I've done during my coding boot camp that are
    relevant to the day's study.

in the meantime though - we start back at square one with the basics:

What is Java?
    - It's a class-based, object-oriented language
    - Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle) in 1991
    - It was first launched on May 23, 1995
    - Between November 13, 2006 and May 8, 2007, Sun released its Java Virtual Machine (JVM) core code available
        as free, open-source software under open-source distribution terms

Terminology:
    - Java Virtual Machine (JVM) :
        * used to execute the bytecode produced by a compiler
        * it should be noted that every operating system (OS) has a different JVM, but the execution of the code
            by Java is the same across across all OS, making it a platform-independent language

    - Java Development Kit (JDK) :
        * a complete development kit that includes the compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), java debuggers,
            java docs, and so forth

    - Java Runtime Environment (JRE) :
        * what allows Java to run
        * includes a browser, JVM, applet supports, plugins

    - Object-Oriented Programming :
        * organizing a program in terms of a collection of objects
        * there are 4 main concepts
            1. Abstraction
            2. Encapsulation
            3. Inheritance
            4. Polymorphism

    1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-java/
        - which is where the guidelines for this 100 days is coming from and you can read more there
    2. My notes as taken from my coding bootcamp textbook, which tend to be very basic bullet points
